INFO: 

This project is going on as a final project for CEPIBASE. We have been asked to create a web with no login just for the operators to take the calls and be able to respond to customers.

The main goal is to practice requests to the database. 

I was not required to do MVC but I wanted to implement it to sharpen my skills. So I checked with my sake holders (my teachers) to propose some ameillorations to the project given. I wanted to avoid three clicks before getting to the information. They give me the ok to the proposal and I am doing the changes needed.
